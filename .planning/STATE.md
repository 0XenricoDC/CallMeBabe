# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-23)

**Core value:** Una chiamata reale in italiano viene gestita end-to-end dal bot (saluto personalizzato, conversazione naturale a bassa latenza, azione completata) senza intervento umano e senza riscrivere codice per un nuovo cliente.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Local Voice Loop

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Local Voice Loop)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: aggregation_timeout must be set to 0.1-0.3s in Phase 1 pipeline — default ~1s blows the 800ms budget before any work is done.
- [Roadmap]: Streaming at every stage (Deepgram streaming → Claude streaming tokens → ElevenLabs streaming TTS) is non-negotiable from Phase 1 — retrofitting is a rewrite.
- [Roadmap]: CalendarProvider, TransportFactory, TenantConfig, and NotificationChannel interface seams must be defined in Phase 1 so Phase 4 (Telnyx) and Phase 5 (multi-tenant) add files behind interfaces rather than restructuring code.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Telnyx) carries a HIGH research flag — DTMF/codec reliability, warm-transfer Dial+Bridge, PSTN latency, and WebSocket-VAD starvation all need targeted review during planning.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Telnyx): HIGH research flag from SUMMARY.md — plan `/gsd:plan-phase 4` should use `--research-phase`.
- Phase 2 (Booking/Calendar): MEDIUM research flag — Google Calendar freebusy inversion and transactional reserve schema have documented subtleties.
